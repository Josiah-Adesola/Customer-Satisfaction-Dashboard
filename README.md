# Customer-Satisfaction-Dashboard


This Customer satisfaction dashboard was made with  Microsoft Excel, a powerful too for Data Analysis and Visualization.

Dashboards helps to explicity see all that's going on in your business or organization. Dashboards are easy to read, understand and make informed decisions.
That means, every business needs a dashboard.

These dashboard was created from a dataset containing the Date, Customer Acquisition Type, State, Product, Price, Units, Revenue, Delivery Performance, Return and Customer Satisfaction.

I made use of pivot tables and charts for visualizations.

Slicers made the dashboard so interactive, for instance you could decide to just see the sales in the Year 2022 or a certain town alone.

I got my data from excelfind.com, you could check them out for tutorial and excel tips.
